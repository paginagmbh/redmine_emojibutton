Redmine Gemoji Plugin
=====================

This plugin enables github style emoji notation in textile formatter and adds a new button to the wiki editor to insert emoji's more easily.

*This plugin is roughly based on a fork of the [redmine_gemoji](https://github.com/tmy/redmine_gemoji) plugin, made by [@tmy](https://github.com/tmy/) and others. Thanks! :smirk:*

*This plugin is listed in the [Redmine plugin directory](http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_emojibutton)*


Compatibility
-------------

The `master` supports Redmine **2.6.x** as well as **3.x** and **4.x**.

**PLEASE NOTE:** The `master` branch uses images to display emojis and therefore has a consistent display across all operating systems. The downside, however, is that there is no support for *latest* Unicode 10+ emojis â€“ and will never be! If you want to use the latest Unicode emojis displayed in the operating systems default emoji font please use the pre-release version v0.6.0 from the `gemoji-4.0-native-emojis-no-images` branch. It uses the `gemoji` gem and displays emojis as native Unicode emojis.



Installation
------------

        $ cd /home/redmine/redmine-${version}/plugins
